        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
        
        <p>
            At the Awesome Science faculty, we have a petty open-minded research facility -- as long as the subjects fall 
            somewhere in the realm of science and technlogy. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, 
            and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our tearm. saying that, of the idea you submitted we were most intrigued 
            by are as follows, in order of priority:
           
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H12O3)
            </li>
            <li>
                Meaning the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperature exceeding 300oC(87oF), whare the
                audience size exponentially increase (effect of 3 x 10^3 increase to 3 x 10^4)
            </li>
            <li>
                HTML and CSS constructs For representing musical scores.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <P>
            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take,
            required staff and other research, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        </P>

            Exotic dance moves
        </h3>
        <p>
            Yes, you are right!. As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dance.
            To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definition: <br>
        </p>
        <h4>
            ploynesian chicken dance
        </h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
             A little Know but very influencial dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chicken,
             to encourage their livestock to be 'fruitful'.
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>
            Icelandic brownian shuffle
        </h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
             Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warn, they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the flow,
             and shuffle their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny,
             very rapid movement, One of my fellow student used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern style such as Twerking.
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>
            Artic robot dance
        </h4>
        <p>
            <ul>
                An intresting example of historic misinformation, English example in the 1960s beleived to have dicovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", still movement,
                being practiced, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and canada. later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.
            </ul>
        </p>
